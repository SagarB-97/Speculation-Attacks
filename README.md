# Speculation-Attacks
Speculative execution in hardware is well known to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. This project aims to simulate spectre attacks on GEMs and the different defence mechanisms proposed. More specifically, we want to simulate cache-timing attacks and evaluate defenses like Invispec and SHARP on various metrics.
